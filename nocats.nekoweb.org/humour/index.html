<h1>Humour</h1>
<p>This is collection of jokes and interesting quotes.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Humour - General</h3>
<p>
  What did unemployment office worker say on his last day after being fired?
</p>
<p>
  See you tomorrow.
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Humour - Bektashi</h3>
<p>
  The Bektashis are one of many Sufi orders within Sunni Islam. Bektashi jokes often poke fun at orthodox religious views by having a Bektashi dervish compared to more conventional believer.
</p>
<hr>

<p>
  A Bektashi was a passenger in a rowing boat travelling from Eminönü to Üsküdar in Istanbul. When a storm blew up, the boatman tried to reassure him by saying "Fear not—God is great!" the Bektashi replied, "Yes, God is great, but the boat is small."
</p>
<hr>

<p>
   A Bektashi was praying in the mosque. While those around him were praying "May God grant me faith," he muttered "May God grant me plenty of wine." The imam heard him and asked angrily why instead of asking for faith like everyone else, he was asking God for something sinful. The Bektashi replied, "Well, everyone asks for what they don't have."
</p>

<h3>Quotes - General</h3>
<p>
  There are two types of fool. The first says “This is old and therefore good”, and the other says “This is new and therefore better”

Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. -T.S. Eliot, The Sacred Wood 
</p>
<hr>

<p>
  Good artists copy. Great artists steal. - Pablo Picasso, stealing the quote above
