<h2>Making Website On Nekoweb Guide</h2>
<p>This is page collects knowledge that I have learned through the heel.</p>

<br>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>
  There are plenty of guides to basic HTML page layout and CSS to get you started, just search for any HTML + CSS tutorial,
   I will not waste time recreating the wheel. Instead I want to say this: By deciding to develop a personal website on Nekoweb,
    you have escaped the limitations of the standard web design. The pages you can find on Nekoweb make this quite clear with their
     colorful, busy even overdesigned looks. There are many moving elements that compete for your attention.
      This is a good thing. It means that the creators of these websites have used the opportunity to create websites that
       they would never be able to while working on website for business reasons. Websites that have become a rarity.
</p>
<p>
  So, go and create a website with navigation circle instead of a navbar or bombard the visitor with several moving illustrations. 
  Don't add a header and footer to your site just because you can copy them from w3schools and you don't know what else to do but
   copy any code you see. You will end up with a boring, regular website like this.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Dashboard</h3>

<h4>"Folder does not exist, go to root" error on dashboard</h4>
<p>You have to create a folder youraccountname.nekoweb.org and put your all files there.</p>

<br>
<h3>Using Nekocode</h3>
<p>
  Nekocode is in-browser code editor made for creating Nekoweb sites.
   It has a livew preview feature that is one of the fastest ways to see how your changes affect the site. This is why it is good for beginners.
</p>
<h4>
  Reopening closed live preview tab
</h4>
<p>
  You can open live preview if you have closed it by right clicking on an active html document and choosing the first option, "Show live preview"
</p>

<br>
<h3>General web development</h3>

<h4>Naming the html files</h4>
<p>
  Put each page in its own folder and name it index.html. If you do this, the page will be loaded automatically when you write:
</p>
<p><code>
  base_url/your_site/your_subpage_folder
</code></p>
<p>
  to the browser and you dont need to write:
</p>
<p><code>
  base_url/your_site/your_subpage_folder.subpage.html
</code></p>

<p>
  index.html is the standard for the main page that's served when you visit a domain. It works for all directories, not just domain root.
</p>
<p><code>
  http://foo.com/bar
</code></p>
<p>
  is interpreted as
</p>

<p><code>
  http://foo.com/bar/index.html
</code></p>
<p>
  on the server.
</p>

<h4>Navigation to other pages on your site & paths to resources such as images:</h4>

<p>
It is best to use relative file paths so your pages will not be bound to your current base URL. Links will work locally (localhost) and even if you move to another host.
</p>

<p>
Absolute:
</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;img src="https://www.website.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="picture"&gt;
</code>
</p>

<p>
Relative:
</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;img src="/../images/picture.jpg" alt="placeholder"&gt;
</code>
</p>

<p>
So site navigation on a page in a folder below the home page can be done with:
</p>
<code>
<p>
  &lt;a href="/../" title="back to homepage">Homepage&lt;/a&gt;
</p>
<p>
  &lt;a href="/../another_sub_page/" title="another sub page in folder beneath home"&lt;Subpage&lt;/a&gt;
</p>
</code>

<br>
<h3>Checklist of things you might want</h3>

<h4>favicon</h4>
<p>The icons in the tabs next to name of your site. There are generator sites that you upload image to and they generate icons of correct sizes.</p>

<h4>Style your elements.css and the sitebox</h4>
<p>elements.css defines the sitebox AKA the preview will look like. Make something eye catching. Just don't make it too obnoxious.</p>

<h4>Create rss feed</h4>
<p>TODO</p>
