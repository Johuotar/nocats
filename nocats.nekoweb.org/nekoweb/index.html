<h1>Making Website On Nekoweb Guide</h1>
<p>This is page collects knowledge that I have learned by bashing my head against the wall until I reached enlightenment.
   I'm a beginner merely trying to collect useful information rather than lay down the law,
   so don't take these as absolute truths.</p>

<br>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>
  There are plenty of guides to basic HTML page layout and CSS to get you started, just search for any HTML + CSS tutorial,
   I will not waste time recreating the wheel, besides I'm not competent enough to teach you those skills.
    Instead I want to say this: By deciding to develop a personal website on Nekoweb,
    you have escaped the limitations of the standard web design. The pages you can find on Nekoweb make this quite clear with their
     colorful, busy even overdesigned looks. There are many moving elements that compete for your attention.
      This is a good thing. It means that the creators of these websites have used the opportunity to create websites that
       they would never be able to while working on website for business reasons. Websites that have become a rarity.
</p>
<p>
  So, go and create a website with navigation circle instead of a navbar or bombard the visitor with several moving illustrations. 
  Don't add a header and footer to your site just because you can copy them from w3schools and you don't know what else to do but
   copy any code you see. You will end up with a site like this if you do.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Dashboard</h3>

<h4>"Folder does not exist, go to root" error on dashboard</h4>
<p>You have to create a folder youraccountname.nekoweb.org and put your all files there.</p>

<br>
<h3>Using Nekocode</h3>
<p>
  Nekocode is in-browser code editor made for creating Nekoweb sites.
   It has a livew preview feature that is one of the fastest ways to see how your changes affect the site. This is why it is good for beginners.
</p>
<h4>
  Reopening closed live preview tab
</h4>
<p>
  You can open live preview if you have closed it by right clicking on an active html document and choosing the first option, "Show live preview"
</p>

<br>
<h3>General web development</h3>

<h4>Reload the your edited page with CTRL + SHIFT + R</h4>
<p>
   Since you visit your page regularly, your browser loads some of the site data from locally stored files.
    A hard refresh - CTRL + SHIFT + R - makes the browser reload all the data from the web, making your edits to the site appear.
     "Use it early, use it often!"
</p>

<h4>Naming the html files</h4>
<p>
  Put each page in its own folder and name it index.html. If you do this, the page will be loaded automatically when you write:
</p>
<p><code>
  base_url/your_site/your_subpage_folder
</code></p>
<p>
  to the browser and you dont need to write:
</p>
<p><code>
  base_url/your_site/your_subpage_folder.subpage.html
</code></p>

<p>
  index.html is the standard for the main page that's served when you visit a domain. It works for all directories, not just domain root.
</p>
<p><code>
  http://foo.com/bar
</code></p>
<p>
  is interpreted as
</p>

<p><code>
  http://foo.com/bar/index.html
</code></p>
<p>
  on the server.
</p>

<h4>Navigation to other pages on your site & paths to resources such as images:</h4>

<p>
It is best to use relative file paths so your pages will not be bound to your current base URL. Links will work locally (localhost) and even if you move to another host.
</p>

<p>
Absolute:
</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;img src="https://www.website.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="picture"&gt;
</code>
</p>

<p>
Relative:
</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;img src="/../images/picture.jpg" alt="placeholder"&gt;
</code>
</p>

<p>
So site navigation on a page in a folder below the home page can be done with:
</p>
<code>
<p>
  &lt;a href="/../" title="back to homepage">Homepage&lt;/a&gt;
</p>
<p>
  &lt;a href="/../another_sub_page/" title="another sub page in folder beneath home"&lt;Subpage&lt;/a&gt;
</p>
</code>

<h4>Add HTML to a site so it does not get interpreted, but is instead presented as code by using HTML entities</h4>
<p>Common problems might be having greater than and less than signs be interpreted as HTML code, causing code example to turn into actual element!</p>
<p>HTML entities fix this. Entities look like this: &entity_name</p>
<p>When you want a &lt; write & and then lt; instead.</p>
<p>When you want a &gt; write & and then gt; instead.</p>

<h3>Checklist of things you might want</h3>

<h4>favicon</h4>
<p>The icons in the tabs next to name of your site. There are generator sites that you upload image to and they generate icons of correct sizes.</p>

<h4>Style your elements.css and the sitebox</h4>
<p>elements.css defines the sitebox AKA the preview will look like. Make something eye catching. Just don't make it too obnoxious.</p>
<p><a href="https://jbc.lol/utils/nekobox/" alt="nekobox">Nekobox</a> is a tool that can help with both sitebox and postbox (RSS feed) customization.</p>

<h4>Classic 88x31 buttons or badges</h4>
<p>In the old web, we used to have these 88x31 pixel size buttons, often GIFs, that were usually links to other people's sites.
   It all started in somewhere around 1996 with badges made by company called Netscape that read "Netscape Now!". Many buttons still feature the "Now!" text because of that.
    It was some kind of affliate program, but that is beside the point. The buttons, or badges, are cool and you want to have them.
   Here are some examples I have found or made myself.
</p>

<img src="/images/whycontainit.png" alt="deus ex why contain it meme/reference">
<img src="/images/outfuckingskilled.png" alt="outskilled button">
<img src="/images/nowebp.gif" alt="no webp, use png">

<p>Learn more about the buttons <a href="https://neonaut.neocities.org/cyber/88x31">here</a> (also includes MANY examples):</p>

<p>Look at more examples by clicking the button below:</p>

<h3>Create RSS feed</h3>
<h4>Basics of RSS feed</h4>
<p>
  RSS means Really Simple Syndication. It is a way of alerting subscribers about site updates and it does so without requiring an you to collect
  a mailing list or any account information of any kind. I recommend using the following guide to create your RSS feeds, it's not that hard, hence the name.
</p>
<a href="https://caffeineandlasers.neocities.org/blogs/rss">Caffeine and Lasers RSS guide at Neocities</a>

<h4>Subscribe to RSS Feeds</h4>
<p>You can download RSS reader software to keep up to date with Nekoweb sites. You can also use them to confirm your RSS feed works.
   I recommend <a href="https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard" alt="RSS Guard github link">RSS Guard (GitHub)</a> which is free & GPL-3.0 licensed.</p>

<h4>Add RSS Icon to Your Site</h4>
<p>Example RSS feed icon that links to your feed for RSS readers (You need to provide the icon in images folder yourself):
  &lt;a href="https://yoursite.nekoweb.org/feed.xml"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/rss_logo.png" alt="rss feed" style="width:32px; height:32px;"&gt; Your Site Feed&lt;/a&gt;
</p>

<h4>RSS feed and Nekoweb Features</h4>
<p>So you have a functioning RSS feed? You're not done though. Nekoweb has unique features for RSS feeds. Learn more at: <a href="https://joosh.help/rss" alt="joosh rss tutorial">joosh.help/rss</a></p>
<p>The guide by Joosh might be outdated since I have been unable to get my RSS posts appear in Nekoweb feed when setting the link to the same webpage but with the #elementID added to the end.
  It might be that it is no longer possible to trick the Nekoweb feed into approving posts that use link that has already been used before, even if you add the link an element on the page to the end.
  If you figure out how to do that I hope you share that information.
</p>
<p>Ensure you have added title, link, guid and pubdate to your posts in the xml file for all Nekoweb RSS features to work. Also add your RSS file to Nekoweb in the settings of your site:</p>
<p>https://nekoweb.org/settings/YOURSITENAMEHERE.nekoweb.org?page=rss</p>
<p>When you have everything above set correctly and you make rss update, your rss post should appear here <a href="https://nekoweb.org/feed" alt="nekoweb feed page">here</a></p>

<h4>Style your Nekoweb RSS Posts</h4>
<p>How RSS posts appear on Nekoweb can be edited. The styling is done in elements.css, same as the sitebox.</p>
<p><a href="https://jbc.lol/utils/nekobox/" alt="nekobox">Nekobox</a> can be used for developing your postbox (RSS feed), just like it helps with sitebox.</p>
