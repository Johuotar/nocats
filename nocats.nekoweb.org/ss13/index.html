<h2>CONNECTING TO MONKESTATION</h2>
<p>
Instead of using Byond, you can also connect to the server by writing the address to browser. Generally you get best ping using the relay closest to you.

<h2>TIPS AND TRICKS TO CONTROLS</h2>
<h4>Using PDA</h4>
<p>Drag PDA from your belt to your sprite to use it without taking it to your hand.</p>

<h4>
Carrying a person on your back
</h4>
<p>Carry another by aggressive grab on someone lying down. Then drag them to yourself. OR Double click drag on them then drag their sprite onto you.</p>

<h4>Show item to another</h4>
<p>Shift middleclick item on hand to show it to others. It appears in a thought bubble.</p>

<h4>Stacking hats in pile of hats and removing them from the stack</h4>
<p>Shift right click pile of hats to remove hat. Spinning/flipping emote with hat on head removes hats too.</p>

<h4>Moving crates on shelves</h4>
<p>Drag it on. Click and drag it onto the shelf. Thats also how you get it off. like, hold lmb and move your cursor over the shelf, then let go</p>

<h2>GUIDE TO NAVIGATION</h2>
<h4>
Port, Starboard and stern
</h4>
<p>Port is left side
Starboard is right side
Stern is the back side

Bow is top
Beam is middle
Quarter is bottom

So Port quarter solars is southwest solars. Starboard quarter is southeast.</p>

<h2>GUIDE TO ENGINEERING</h2>
<h4>Improve your tools and equipment</h4>
<p>Science can research better tools for engineers. Crowbar and wirecutter can be replaced with Jaws of life that has the functions of both.
   Hand drill has functions of screwdriver and wrench. Switch between the mode by activating the tool in hand. Make them at the lathe after science has unlocked them.</p>

<h4>Use both mouse buttons when using tools</h4>
<p>Some construction/deconstruction tasks can require right click instead of left click. e.g deconstruct a shelf with wrench using right click. Try things out!</p>


<h4>SOLAR ARRAY SMES INPUT, OUTPUT & HOTWIRING</h4>
<p>When setting up solars, always set SMES output 10 or more less than the input of solars. 
  This leaves some power to charge the SMES so it can power station even if there is no input from solars. 
  Wiring solars directly to power grid without SMES between has the usual hotwiring risks, meaning anyone touching electrified door gets hurt worse. 
  Solar output is low enough that this might not matter however.</p>


<h4>
Precooled nitrogen flash coolant (on some stations)
</h4>
<p>Some stations have coolant ready for if supermatter gets on fire. Get acquainted with your station!</p>



<h4>What does Xenobio even do other than release deadly aliens to the station?</h4>
<p>Xenobiologist actually do something useful!
   They make passives, cubes that give the person carrying them powers such as regeneration, fire resistance, no need to breath and so on.</p>
